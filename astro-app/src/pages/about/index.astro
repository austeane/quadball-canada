    <p>Quadball is a fast-paced, full-contact mixed-gender sport that combines elements of rugby, dodgeball, and tag. Players compete on broomsticks, working together to score points by getting the quaffle through hoops while avoiding bludgers and seeking the snitch. With a required gender maximum rule, quadball is one of the few sports designed to be inclusive from the ground up.</p>
